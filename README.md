Poaching today poses a significant threat to the preservation of our planet’s biodiversity. It’s impacts reach far beyond the scope of just the extinction of a few individual species, it threatens to destroy the delicate balance of ecosystems. The hunt for elephant ivory, rhino horns, and pangolin scales increases more and more as the demand for them grows higher. Poaching as a business is worth around 5 - 23 billion dollars annually **[1]**. Over 1 million pangolins have been poached in the last decade making them arguably the most illegally trafficked animal in the world **[2][3]**, a rhino is poached every 20 hours in South Africa with 11,680 being poached since 2008 **[4]**, and over 90% of African Elephants have been killed over the last century **[3]**. Between the years 2006 and 2017, 10,000 to 17,000 elephants were poached, yielding an annual ivory count of 100 to 170 tons **[5]**. Over the last 3 decades, African forest elephants have suffered a population decrease of 86% **[6]**. A population decline of these animals don’t just threaten ecosystems but also contribute to our planet’s rapidly increasing temperature. An African forest elephant extinction would lead to a “7% decrease in the above ground biomass in Central African rainforests,” a decrease in rhino populations would lead to an increased severity and frequency of wildfire which would lead to an increased amount of carbon emissions, and a decrease in pangolins would lead to less natural termite predators whose decomposing process results in 1 - 3% of global carbon emissions **[6]**. However, in the modern era, technology has emerged as a powerful tool to help combat poaching. Park rangers need a way to efficiently navigate through the park and monitor as much of the park as possible. The question we are trying to answer here today is how can a park ranger, given points of interest in a park, most efficiently navigate through all of the points in a timely manner?
